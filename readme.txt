# Description
Memory game is the project which i developed with the help of my team. This game is like matching the pair of similar symbols or images in a given 4*4 matrix. Initially it will be given in a random order by making it invisible to the player. Once the user clicks the start game button, the timer will start from 0 secs and never stop untill the player completes the game or he clicks the quit button.

The image when clicked on it will be visible for only limited time untill the second image is clicked, or else it will dissappear. If the images get matched they will stay same. Everytime the images get matched, the number of pairs column gets updated by 1. Once it reaches 8, the game will be completed and the timer will stop.
